## Reflection


In order to practice using localStorage to store user session information in the frontend and get used to DOM manipulation, I created a todo app where users can organize their tasks into projects, assign them priority levels, and view what they need for the current day and week.


A challenge I ran into was accounting for each possible user interaction and how it would affect how the todos are arranged. For example, a user may want to change the current date of a todo, which additionally changes whether the item is eligible in “today” and “this week” sections. While simple features, adding each led to more nuances to consider.
